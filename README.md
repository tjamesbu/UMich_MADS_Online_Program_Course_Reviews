# UMich_MADS_Online_Program_Course_Reviews

Hi there!  I'm currently in my 4th semester out of 5 in the Masters in Applied Data Science (MADS) program created by the University of Michigan.  I am going to share some experiences I had during this program to help others prepare in-advance for what to expect.

A little bit about me.  I come from a bachelors in Biology.  I have 6 years of experience substitute-teaching grades K-12, and 12 years of experience tutoring.  I have always been a hard working student, athlete, and outdoorsman throughout my life. I also am musically inclined and enjoy playing trumpet and piano. I enjoy learning more as well as staying healthy mentally and physically.  Currently considering pursuing a PhD in data science. If you ever want to have an intelligent conversation involving idea-swapping or sharing-experiences, feel free to contact me at tjamesum@umich.edu.

SIADS 501: Being a Data Scientist:
    This course mostly was written assignments meant to help you start thinking in a more organized manner of research ideas for future milestone projects.  The assigned readings were very interesting from books you can find free online.  There are different graders grading different students' assignments, so don't hesitate to email the main professor and speak-up if you feel as if you were graded incorrectly or misinterpreted/misunderstood. Most of the graders only have a computer/tech/engineering background and may not understand your discussions if you start writing about medical literature like I did.  I also recommend asking professors for the writing-assignment grading rubric right when class starts if it has not been provided, yet.  This will make it easier for you to know how much you need to explain for each short-answer question and prevent loss of points on your week one assignment.  Improvements I would suggest for this couerse are providing examples of past successful milestone/capstone projects to students and helping the students become more familiar with all of the tools available for presenting milestone projects, such as Datapane and Deepnote.  How to collaborate with project teammates while using Google Colab, Deepnote, and/or Github would also be more valuable and useful knowledge for data science students than putting so much attention towards the Question/Maxim/Ethical-Commitment method of thinking. 

SIADS 505: Data Manipulation:
    This is the first coding-intensive course you will take.  Having already completed the Applied Data Science with Python specialization by UMich through Coursera will help you out a lot with the week 1 & 2 labs for this course.  Week 1 lab is mainly RegEx coding.  Being familiar with how to use the lambda function in python can be useful for the week 3 assignment and possibly others.  I would recommend making it to the office hours that you can and seeking help from classmates when needed.

SIADS 502: Math Methods:
    This course is meant to provide you with some essential math topics related to data science.  Unfortunately, it lacked organization and ability to utilize any of the lecture topics in the assignments.  Assignments thankfully were not difficult.  Would recommend more focus of the lectures put towards Bayes Theorem and A/B Testing in the future, rather than giving students materials during lecture they can't practice applying during the lab assignments.
    
SIADS 522: Information Visualization I:
    This course had very interesting and thorough lecture videos.  Some extra videos, recorded through youtube, were also availble in the resources section and partially helped with understanding how to apply the assignment topics.  Before each week's lab was a demo lab that demonstrated some of the skills needed for the assignment.  The weekly lab assignments consisted of two short-answer questions related to lecture material, and coding.  Not all the examples provided in the demo lab were helpful for the assignment, and sometimes you have to dig through the internet, or your classmates, for better examples to better understand what is being asked in the lab assignment.  Professor comes from a computer-science/tech/engineering background and prefers assuming all students have had 5+ years of coding experience already and should be able to guess-and-check mostly on their own before they can learn.  Recommended improvements for this course would be improving the demo lab examples to better demonstrate what skills are being asked for in the weekly lab assignments, enhancing communication/support levels between professor and students, and reminding the instructor not to assume all students have 5+ years of coding experience.

SIADS 652: Network Analysis:
    This course was really cool, covering topics useful in network analysis that even Google once used such as hiearchal-clustering.  Professors are helpful, but don't hesitate to work together with classmates also if you need to.  Quizzes were challenging if you attempted to do them on your own and don't have undergrad experience in computers/tech/engineering.  Some demo labs before the weekly lab assignments would have been useful as well to better aid the learning of students still around the intermediate python program level.  Lectures were thorough and very interesting if you are interested in social media analysis and network analysis.    

SIADS 680: Learning Analytics:
    The lectures of this course were very interesting, containing 2-3 interview videos per week (ranging from 30-60min) and 1-2 lecture videos from a University of Michigan educational research professor you don't get to meet during office hours.  You also are assigned 3-4 research literature readings to complete each week, and are required to type a two paragraphs (one for each discussion question) each week while using a source from the readings and citing your sources. Lectures do not correlate with the labs at all, so I would recommend getting an early start on the labs and saving the lectures for later so you can catch help during office hours if needed.  A much lower student attendance in this course compared to other courses.  The week 4 lab they keep reminding you to try to work-ahead on each week is not as difficult as they make it seem, but is also a little tricky if you are not experienced assembling multiple charts into a single plotly-dashboard.  They may or may not have other options, such as using Altair, in the future for the week 4 lab assignment.  Office hours by Prof Sheltrown are really interesting and informative while he shares his experiences using data science in the education field.  Wish more professors would offer more informative instruction to help students learn more like he does with his office hours.
    
SIADS 681: Health Analytics:
    Experience the first week of this brand new course during Fall 2022.  The lecture videos were very interesting and informative about how data science/analytics is currently being used in health informatics.  The disease focused on during weeks 1-3 was diabetes, and during week 4 was COVID-19. The lab assignments were not nearly as friendly as in SIADS 680, and required a lot of students to seek better clarifications during office hours and through Slack.  The lab assignments were setup to where you have both a jupyter notebook and a .py file with python coding.  Your task is to correlate between the two and determine the missing code that was marked as missing.  I found myself filling in other unmarked parts of the code, and still getting credit for certain lab questions, while trying to understand the instructions and figure out what needs to be inserted.  Other students who did figure out the assignments admitted it was tricky and the instructions were not as detailed as they could have been.  Alongside the multiple weekly lab assignments, you also are expected to read medical literature and complete quizzes based on 1-2 of the articles you read/skimmed. Instructor stated the purpose of the articles is to help students interested in working in the field of health analytics to become more comfortable and familiar with medical discussions at their potential future jobs.  Coming from a background in biology, and having experience in teaching/tutoring, I disagree with this setup and think the instructors for this course overexpected a little more than they should have. Just as I would not expect a student who has been studying python programming for only 2-3 years to be able to perform/understand some intense coding on his/her own, I also wouldn't expect a student who has been studying computers/tech/engineering the past 5 years to be able to comprehend medical literature in one week. Just because students with tech backgrounds have an interest in health analytics, they should not be expected to already have a background that allows them to understand terminology in medical literature. The lab coding setup was also different than any other previous course in MADS, and students should not be expected to adapt to this different style of coding in only one week when real-world jobs typically give you 3-6 months to adapt. Providing this style of coding as an extra reference at the end of the course would instead would be recommended. Providing data-science research project examples containing less medical terminology in-place of the current articles, and recreating the quizzes, would also be recommended. More than half the students initally enrolled dropped the course within the first week, as did I.  We will see if MADS decides to make any improvements for the course betweeen now and next semester.
