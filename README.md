# UMich_MADS_Online_Program_Course_Reviews

Hi there!  I'm currently in my 4th semester out of 5 in the Masters in Applied Data Science (MADS) program created by the University of Michigan.  I am going to share some experiences I had during this program to help others prepare in-advance for what to expect.

A little bit about me.  I come from a bachelors in Biology.
