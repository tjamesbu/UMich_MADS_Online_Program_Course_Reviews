# UMich_MADS_Online_Program_Course_Reviews

Hi there!  I'm currently in my 4th semester out of 5 in the Masters in Applied Data Science (MADS) program created by the University of Michigan.  I am going to share some experiences I had during this program to help others prepare in-advance for what to expect.

A little bit about me.  I come from a bachelors in Biology.  I have 6 years of experience substitute-teaching grades K-12, and 12 years of experience tutoring.  I have always been a hard working student, athlete, and outdoorsman throughout my life. I also am musically inclined and enjoy playing trumpet and piano. I enjoy learning more as well as staying healthy mentally and physically.  Currently considering pursuing a PhD in data science. If you ever want to have an intelligent conversation involving idea-swapping or sharing-experiences, feel free to contact me at tjamesum@umich.edu.
