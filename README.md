# UMich_MADS_Online_Program_Course_Reviews

Hi there!  I'm currently in my 4th semester out of 5 in the Masters in Applied Data Science (MADS) program created by the University of Michigan.  I am going to share some experiences I had during this program to help others prepare in-advance for what to expect.

A little bit about me.  I come from a bachelors in Biology.  I have 6 years of experience substitute-teaching grades K-12, and 12 years of experience tutoring.  I have always been a hard working student, athlete, and outdoorsman throughout my life. I also am musically inclined and enjoy playing trumpet and piano. I enjoy learning more as well as staying healthy mentally and physically.  Currently considering pursuing a PhD in data science. If you ever want to have an intelligent conversation involving idea-swapping or sharing-experiences, feel free to contact me at tjamesum@umich.edu.

SIADS 501: Being a Data Scientist:
    This course mostly was written assignments meant to help you start thinking in a more organized manner of research ideas for future milestone projects.  The assigned readings were very interesting from books you can find free online.  There are different graders grading different students' assignments, so don't hesitate to email the main professor and speak-up if you feel as if you were graded incorrectly or misinterpreted/misunderstood. Most of the graders only have a computer/tech/engineering background and may not understand your discussions if you start writing about medical literature like I did.  I also recommend asking professors for the writing-assignment grading rubric right when class starts if it has not been provided, yet.  This will make it easier for you to know how much you need to explain for each short-answer question and prevent loss of points on your week one assignment.  Improvements I would suggest for this couerse are providing examples of past successful milestone/capstone projects to students and helping the students become more familiar with all of the tools available for presenting milestone projects, such as Datapane and Deepnote.  How to collaborate with project teammates while using Google Colab, Deepnote, and/or Github would also be more valuable and useful knowledge for data science students than putting so much attention towards the Question/Maxim/Ethical-Commitment method of thinking. 

SIADS 505: Data Manipulation:
    This is the first coding-intensive course you will take.  Having already completed the Applied Data Science with Python specialization by UMich through Coursera will help you out a lot with the week 1 & 2 labs for this course.  Week 1 lab is mainly RegEx coding.  Being familiar with how to use the lambda function in python can be useful for the week 3 assignment and possibly others.  I would recommend making it to the office hours that you can and seeking help from classmates when needed.

SIADS 502: Math Methods:
    This course is meant to provide you with some essential math topics related to data science.  Unfortunately, it lacked organization and ability to utilize any of the lecture topics in the assignments.  Assignments thankfully were not difficult.  Would recommend more focus of the lectures put towards Bayes Theorem and A/B Testing in the future, rather than giving students materials during lecture they can't practice applying during the lab assignments.
    
SIADS 522: Information Visualization I:
    This course had very interesting and thorough lecture videos.  Some extra videos, recorded through youtube, were also availble in the resources section and partially helped with understanding how to apply the assignment topics.  Before each week's lab was a demo lab that demonstrated some of the skills needed for the assignment.  The weekly lab assignments consisted of two short-answer questions related to lecture material, and coding.  Not all the examples provided in the demo lab were helpful for the assignment, and sometimes you have to dig through the internet, or your classmates, for better examples to better understand what is being asked in the lab assignment.  Professor comes from a computer-science/tech/engineering background and prefers assuming all students have had 5+ years of coding experience already and should be able to guess-and-check mostly on their own before they can learn.  Recommended improvements for this course would be improving the demo lab examples to better demonstrate what skills are being asked for in the weekly lab assignments, enhancing communication/support levels between professor and students, and reminding the instructor not to assume all students have 5+ years of coding experience.
