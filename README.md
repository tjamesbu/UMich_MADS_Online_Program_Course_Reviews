# UMich_MADS_Online_Program_Course_Reviews

Hi there!  I'm currently in my 4th semester out of 5 in the Masters in Applied Data Science (MADS) program created by the University of Michigan.  I am going to share some experiences I had during this program to help others prepare in-advance for what to expect.

A little bit about me.  I come from a bachelors in Biology.  I have 6 years of experience substitute-teaching grades K-12, and 12 years of experience tutoring.  I have always been a hard working student, athlete, and outdoorsman throughout my life. I also am musically inclined and enjoy playing trumpet and piano. I enjoy learning more as well as staying healthy mentally and physically.  Currently considering pursuing a PhD in data science. If you ever want to have an intelligent conversation involving idea-swapping or sharing-experiences, feel free to contact me at tjamesum@umich.edu.

SIADS 501: Being a Data Scientist:
    This course mostly was written assignments meant to help you start thinking in a more organized manner of research ideas for future milestone projects.  The assigned readings were very interesting from books you can find free online.  There are different graders grading different students' assignments, so don't hesitate to email the main professor and speak-up if you feel as if you were graded incorrectly or misinterpreted/misunderstood. Most of the graders only have a computer/tech/engineering background and may not understand your discussions if you start writing about medical literature like I did.  I also recommend asking professors for the writing-assignment grading rubric right when class starts if it has not been provided, yet.  This will make it easier for you to know how much you need to explain for each short-answer question and prevent loss of points on your week one assignment.  Improvements I would suggest for this couerse are providing examples of past successful milestone/capstone projects to students and helping the students become more familiar with all of the tools available for presenting milestone projects, such as Datapane,
